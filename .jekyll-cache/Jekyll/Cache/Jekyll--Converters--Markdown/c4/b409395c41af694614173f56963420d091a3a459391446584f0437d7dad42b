<p>Itâ€™s been a while since Iâ€™ve updated dependencies for this site so I decided to ensure that all the dependencies are updated.  The fact that this site uses <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> which requires <a href="http://npmjs.com/">NPM</a> makes updating the dependencies very easy.</p>

<p>The image above includes a command for updating the version of various dependencies contained within this projects package.json file.</p>

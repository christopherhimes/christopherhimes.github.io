<p>Guess â€˜nowâ€™ is relative with working at home for the last two years. As of yesterday I no longer have a desk at an office that I could return to when this whole pandemic blows over.</p>

<p>I have a new role, responsibilities, and more people relying on me than I ever have before. This requires me to make fewer explorations into pet projects. In the past I could find some faster way of doing something work related but now I need to delegate that activity to someone else.</p>

<p>As a Product Owner the daily activites do not typically require much coding so Iâ€™m thinking of spending more personal time trying different things out. I downloaded <a href="https://blender.org">blender</a> again and am thinkig of playing with some procedural generation. Last week I wrote some <a href="https://python.org">python</a> code to grab some image data so I am thinking about some python projects down the road as well.</p>

<p>Before digging too much into any of that this siteâ€™s dependencies are out of control</p>

* Took our boy Tater to the vet to get a mani pedi. He did great and when we left he did a little strut feeling good.
* Made a different recipe for baguettes which went better but was not quite where they should be. I'll keep making changes to see how I can improve.
* Played some Overwatch 2 with Matthew.
* Applied for a few jobs each day.
* Added a few recurring job application items to the [Espanso] Text Expander configuration.

This is day {{ page.tag_numbers["100 Days To Offload"] }}  of #100DaysToOffload.

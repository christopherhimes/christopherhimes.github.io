* Weather cooperated so I was able to get out in the garden and clean some stuff up, pulling weeds, and stringing up my chaotic tomatoes.
* Cut the lawn and did some weed whacking but I'm less excited about that.
* Leah went back to work so I made some dinners.
* I surprised Leah with homemade baguettes! They were made from a flour that she was able to eat without any gluten sensitivity issues!
* Updated my resume to make sure everything was in my own words versus AI rephrased.
* Updated LinkedIn and applied to a few jobs.
* I posted a couple reviews that use a template I made about a month ago.
* Had to reinengineer the og-image setup to accommodate emoji which was a little frustrating.
* Still getting back into a normal schedule.
* Had a little bit of a shave.

Phantom Island by King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard is their 27th studio album and a venture into the psychedelic and orchestretic. This feels like an album from another time with songs like Spacesick sounding like Space Oddity by David Bowie ala Ziggy Stardust. I think this is my favorite song on the album with Silent Spirit a close second.

Sometimes there is too much going on in some of the songs here but it is an ejoyable listen.

### Toggle

I've added a  toggle to the footer of the page that allows you to switch between light mode and dark mode. Not sure if this should be in the main navigation though as it is hard to find. I don't think it's working as well as I would like just yet so it's a soft launch I guess.

### Experiments Page

I created a page dedicated to things I'm experimenting with on the site. As of now there is just one experiment [Cat Look] but the intention is to continue to add.

### Reviews

I used the media format I discussed in the last [a few experiments] post to write some reviews. I have a few more in draft that I'm still working on. This seems like an okay way for me to write more without having to invent a new project every few days. Especially when I don't seem to have much to say in the week notes.

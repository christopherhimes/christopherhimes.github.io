* Took our boy Tater to the vet to get a mani pedi. He did great and when we left he did a little strut feeling good.
* Made a different recipe for baguettes which went better but was not quite where they should be. I'll keep making changes to see how I can improve.
* Played some Overwatch 2 with Matthew.
* Applied for a few jobs each day.
* Added a few recurring job application items to the [Espanso] Text Expander configuration.
* Wrote a review of [Lake Mungo].
* Made some baguettes that turned out pretty well this time around.
* Wrote a reviews page that I'll be making a post about later.

Added a [colophon].

Wikipedia lists a colophon as:

> In publishing, a colophon (/ˈkɒləfən, -fɒn/) is a brief statement containing information about the publication of a book such as an "imprint" (the place of publication, the publisher, and the date of publication).

My intention is to record the site history, technology stack, and other details of the site there. Really though, check that out if you're interested in what drives this site.

This is day 3 of #100DaysToOffload.

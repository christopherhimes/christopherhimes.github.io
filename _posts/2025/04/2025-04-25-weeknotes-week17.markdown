* Applied to some jobs.
* Corrected the deprecated warning for the @import command used for comments on this site. Switched to @use.
* Weather ☀️ has been nice so I've been working in the yard.
* Had a call about what I'm looking for at a potential employer. Conversation was good but they do not currently have an open position for what I'm looking for.
* Completed the capstone project for the Product Owner IBM certification on Coursera. I don't usually post to LinkedIn but I did this time. Nice to celebrate a win.

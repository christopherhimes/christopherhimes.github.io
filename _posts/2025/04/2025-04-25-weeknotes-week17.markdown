* Applied to some jobs.
* Corrected the deprecated warning in the SASS for the @import command used for comments on this site. Switched to @use.
* Weather ‚òÄÔ∏è has been nice so I've been working in the yard. The garden beds need some serious care so I'm getting them cleaned up and ready for planting.
* Had a call about what I'm looking for at a potential employer. Conversation was good but they do not currently have an open position for what I'm looking for. It was nice to talk about my experience either way.
* Completed the capstone project for the Product Owner IBM certification on Coursera. I don't usually post to LinkedIn but I did this time. Nice to celebrate a win.
* Today was my wife's late mom's birthday, so we went to the cemetery to honor her and place some flowers. The irises we planted last year are looking good which is nice. üíê

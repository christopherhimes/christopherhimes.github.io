This is day 1 of #100DaysToOffload.

[100 Days To Offload] is a challenge to publish 100 posts on your personal blog in a year.

I've been trying to write more so I thought this would be a fun challenge. If you go to the website for the challenge they have a hall of fame for people that completed it. This means there are a number of interesting personal blogs to follow as well. Found a few more for the RSS reader.

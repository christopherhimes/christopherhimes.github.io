Right now I'm in between roles, and instead of just waiting for the next thing, I'm using the time to grow. I've been doing the Product Owner role for a while, working with Agile teams, managing backlogs, and collaborating with stakeholders, but I realized I’ve never taken a step back to really study it.

So I jumped into some Product Owner courses on Coursera. It’s been helpful to put structure around what I already know and pick up new tools for prioritizing, communicating, and delivering better outcomes. This time is all about getting better.

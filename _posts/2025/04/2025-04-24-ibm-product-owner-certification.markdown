Currently between roles and one thing I knew immediately that I wanted to do with the extra time was get a certification. I've always been doing more informal self improvement and learning but now seemed like a good time to have a little something to show for it and make it a bit more official.

So I jumped into some Product Owner courses on Coursera. This track had seven classes with a few projects that were graded. I did learn a few new strategies for prioritization and negotiation which I plan to discuss over the coming weeks.

I miss having a team that is building something together but that will come in time. For now I'm bettering myself both because I want to and because it will help with whatever the next thing is.

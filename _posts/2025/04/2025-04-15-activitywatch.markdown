ActivityWatch is an app that automatically tracks how you spend time on your devices.

Like I mentioned in a previous post I found some new people to follow in my RSS reader. One of those people is [Joel] who's feed introduced me to the service [ActivityWatch]. This is now currently running on my machine so I can see how exactly I'm spending my time.

My intention for now is simply to use the reporting for self reflection. Not sure if I want to be publishing any stats publicly.

This is day {{ page.tag_numbers["100 Days To Offload"] }}  of #100DaysToOffload.

## Ingredients
* 3 cups flour
* 1 1/2 cups lukewarm water
* 2 tsp yeast
* 1 tsp salt

## Method

### Preparation Day 1
1. Combine 1/2 cup of lukewarm water and 2 tsp (or 1 packet) of dry yeast and let sit for ten minutes.
1. Then combine with the flour, remaining lukewarm water and salt.
1. This should be kneaded for approximately ten minutes or until windowpane[^1] has been achieved.
1. Roll into a ball and place in a greased bowl covered with plastic for 12-20 hours.

### Preparation Day 2
1. At this point the dough should have doubled. Take it out of the bowl and on a floured surface split it into two even portions.
1. Each portion should be stretched long and each end folded to meet in the middle resulting in a rectangle shape. Then in the other direction fold a third over from either direction. This should result in a slightly narrower rectangle. These should be left for 10 minutes before continuing.
1. Each rested portion should be rolled into a baguette shape. Roll them out and allow the ends to go to a point.
1. Once shaped each baguette should be placed on a floured kitchen towel with the towel used as a barrier between the baguettes. Think taco holder at a restaurant. They should be left to rise a final time for 2 hours. Keeping them close but separate should force the rice up versus out.
1. Fifteen minutes before the 2 hours is up preheat the oven to 450 degrees and boil 2 cups of water. I use a cast iron pan to boil the water so it can go right in the oven with the baguettes.

### Bake!
1. Once preheated place the baguettes on a baking sheet in the oven and below them the cast iron pan with boiling water.
1. After ten minutes remove the cast iron pan being careful as it should be steamy in the oven.
1. Bake the baguettes for another 15-20 minutes depending on your oven. Halfway through rotate them for even color.
1. Remove from the oven and move to a cooling rack for at least ten minutes.

## Beyond
This has been a little way to bring back France after our trip earlier this summer. I've tried some [no knead recipes] and have not been happy with the way they turned out. This is still not where I want it to be but I think I'm struggling with the wetness of the dough and that has impacted the final results. I think the next move needs to be to switch to more precise measurements to dial this in.

One thing of note my flour choice which is a Canadian flour from Golden Temple, specifically the Durum Atta Flour. Using this flour means my wife who eats gluten free can enjoy these baguettes. Not sure if it's the durum wheat alone or a combination of that and the pesticides used in the states but American flour is basically off limits for her.

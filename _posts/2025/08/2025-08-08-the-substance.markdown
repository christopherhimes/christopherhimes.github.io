The Substance is a body horror film from 2024 that uses body horror to explore the absurd things that women do to themselves in the of attaining unrealistic body expectations. 

The cinematography throughout is spectacular. The later parts of the film are about the body horror but early in the film is just stuning to watch. An incredible looking film which apparently only cost 18 million dollars. 

I think the performances in this are incredible. This is one of those movies that if you just described it to somebody, not knowing that it's an actual thing that exists, you wouldn't believe it.

The body horror aspect of it, the art behind all of the creature work, the body horror design, is very, very good. I don't think it's the point that you're supposed to feel like this is real. It is convincing enough to gross you out, but it doesn't feel real to me. I'm sure people disagree with that but I don't think that's the point. 

There is a level of craft and intention on display in this film that you do not see very often. If you can stomach it rewatching absolutely returns hidden connections not apparent on the first watch.

One thing I did want to mention about this film is there are good portions that you should absolutely not watch while you're eating food. Your stomach may be turned while watching this film. So, I think it's best to avoid it, especially in the latter half.

 I decided in the last half hour to eat lunch, and I had a couple pieces of pizza. I don't recommend that to other people. I was fine, but I don't expect that for other folks.

* For some reason Tuesday seems to be baguette day around here. I made some [baguettes] again and this time left out a little bit of water and made sure to add enough flour to keep it easy to handle. If it started sticking to the counter or my hands I sprinkled a little bit more into the dough. This appears to paid off as these were by far the best baguettes I've made yet!
* Played some Overwatch 2 with Matthew. Played some on my own and fell from Gold 5 on support to Silver 3. Rewatching a few games to see how I can improve.
* Applied for a few jobs each day. I do give myself the weekends though which is nice.
* Follow up on the call from last week went well. Excited to continue discussions.
* Reworked a bit of this site which I'm going to post more about soon. I wanted something with a bit more color and a bit more personality than the Lato font I was using.
* Rewrote the [/about] page to be more than two quick sentences.
* Drow my son to the movies yesterday to see Freakier Friday with a friend.
* Caught up with missed episodes of Colbert with Leah this morning.
* Made burgers and fries at home this week. Frying up some french fries for the first time in a long while. It's a bit of work but they are delicious.

* Picked some zucchini from the garden. Oh and you can see some baguette in the background too.

* Had a Kamala cat headrest for a while this morning. Managed to get up, make lunch, and sit down without disturbing her. Small victories!

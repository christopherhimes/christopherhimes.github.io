* Made some more baguettes this time only formed two instead of three, kneeded a bit more, and remembered to cut them. The texture was much better this time around.
* Made some Zucchini bread which everyone seemed to like.
* Played some Overwatch 2 with Matthew.
* Applied for a few jobs each day.
* Had a call with some folks about a possible job opportunity that was exciting.
* Worked on a few experiments which aren't really ready to discuss in depth but they're coming along.
* Watched the substance and have some thought I'm working through for a post later.
* Installed [FreshRSS] and spent some time setting that up.
* Listened to the new Tyler The Creator album Don't Tap the Glass.
* Leah got a flat so I did some driving around to drop her off.
* Caught up with missed episodes of Colbert with Leah this morning.

I'm Christopher Himes, an accomplished Product Owner seeking new opportunities for transformation and adding value.

I've been working on adding generated open graph images to the site. I think they're in a good place at the moment but they only apply to blog posts. In order to create a generic one for the site as a whole I wanted to have a simple post that would create one with the correct content. So, that's what you're looking at here.

Sorry there is not more here but stay tuned for the details on getting the open graph image together that is coming soon.

The image associated with this blog post in open graph is also the one associated with any non-blog page on the site. I think it makes it a little nicer. Not that anyone is sharing my [about] section but the the proof of concept is neat anyway.

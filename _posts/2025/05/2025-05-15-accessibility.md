May 15th 2025 was [Accessibility Day]. I started this post on the day but wasn unable to complete it in time. 

I ran the [WAVE] test and was happy with the results on the site. 

{% include img.html src='/blog/accessibility/score.webp' alt='Past lighthouse scores of 100% in all categories but performance and accessibility at 95%' %}

There is a lot more to consider and I'll be working that into the ongoing changes here.

This is day {{ page.tag_numbers["100 Days To Offload"] }}  of #100DaysToOffload.

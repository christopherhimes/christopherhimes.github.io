* Went to the farmer's market and at 8 am it was already bumpin.
    * Bought starters for tomatoes, green bell peppers, cucumbers, and zuchinnis (cukes and zukes as the kids are saying).
    * Got two lantanas for my wife. She really loves the small bursts of colors.
    * Picked us up some starbys ⭐☕ on the way home.
* Planted the starters I got from the farmer's market as well as some seeds I had from last year. These included lettuce, spinach, beans, peas, carrots, onions, chives, tarragon, and sunflowers.
* Doing any kinda gardening directly under an established tree is a bit of a nightmare. I have two garbage cans full of tree roots if you're interested.
* Split some hostas to add more to the freshly mulched front landscaping.
* I've been on a tear digitizing our DVD collections using [MakeMKV]. I'm through mine and have made a sizable dent in Leah's. I'm also using [HandBrake] to make the files a bit more manageable.
* I added accounts for Leah and Noah within [Jellyfin] so we can have our own watch history.
* Pulled out the webmention work for the time being as I haven't gotten it to a good point as of yet.
* Took an assessment an was able to schedule an initial interview next week which is nice.
* Made an appointment at the library to convert a VHS tape to digital. They have a media lab and have a number of devices for converting media.
* Spent some time removing duplicate photos from my collection using [digiKam].
* Updated meta data for my music files using [MusicBrainz Picard].
* Wrote a bit of a a lengthy post I will be publishing on 6/2.
* I'm backdating this post please forgive me.

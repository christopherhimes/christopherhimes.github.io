* Applied to some jobs.
* Posted last weeks week notes late.
* Took some Coursera classes. I'm currently on a DevOps section of the Scrum Master concentration.
* Signed up for the CSPO class next week!
* Took some practice tests for the PSPO certification.
* Weather was nice yesterday so I spent a few hours on the yard. Cut the grass for the first time this year, trimmed the bushes, and did more cleanup.
* Hops are really doing well with all the rain so I moved their lines to the top of the sunroom.
* Updated resume on this site.
* Getting ready for my sister's commencements tomorrow in Mt. Peazy.

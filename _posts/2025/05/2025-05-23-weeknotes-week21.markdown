* Pulled weeds and double turned the garden beds in advance of planting the vegetable garden.
* Cleaned up the back yard, removing old leaves overgrown trees along the fence, and sweeping out the trampoline.
* Made more changes to the resume removing some uses of the word 'product' to focus more on product ownership rather than the product that was represented in the retail catalog.
* Bought an external CD/DVD drive to start digitalizing some items. I've been in a chicken üêî or the egg ü•ö situation with getting a NAS so I'm going to use some free time to put together the media that would fill out the library. I'm using the beta Linux version of [MakeMKV] for this.
* Installed and setup [Jellyfin] on my computer. This required updating the /etc/fstab file as I had some user specific items in there that was preventing Jellyfin from detecting the existing media. After that it was an easy setup and connection to the apps on both my phone and Roku.
* Spent some time experimenting with Webmentions. I have a blog post in my drafts folder but I haven't decided on the exact implementation just yet. I did run a test and confirm it works I just haven't written all I want to say just yet.
* TODAY IS MY ONE YEAR WEDDING ANNIVERSARY! üéâ

* Completed the CSPO class and am now a Cetrified Scrum Product Owner with Scrum Alliance.  
* Spent a bunch of time in the yard. I've got 8 paper bags and four garbage cans full of yard waste this week. I'm exhausted ðŸ˜´
* Trimmed hops up a few feet to make it easy to maintain the few main line.
* Attended my sister's commencements in Mt. Peazy over a week ago now. 
* Mother's Day activities at Le Crepe and Sedona.
* Painted with a twist.
* So, I get this text from my wife, "It's all or nothing..." We're watching the latest Married at First Sight on Netflix.
* More True Blood. ðŸ©¸

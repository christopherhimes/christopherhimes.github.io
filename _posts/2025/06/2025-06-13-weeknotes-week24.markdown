* Sent in a few more job applications.
* Spent more time removing duplicate photos from my collection using [digiKam]. Turns out downloading files from Google Photos, Facebook, Instagram, and wherever else you've uploaded them is not the best move. Getting down to lowe single digit duplicates but those are in the hundreds.
* Bought some Birthday gifts for my niece who is turning 7.
* The fact that I set this up did not help [circa last week], "Setting up the draft for next week in the hopes that I have more to report then."
* Bought steel cable to hang patio lights and then I hung them.
* Pool is up and running. I'm yet to get in yet but it's only been about a week.
* School is out for summer so we went to Coney Island to celebrate.
* Bought a backpack and new shoes for the trip to France.

* Converted the VHS tapes I had planned to at the library. They were pretty degraded so they're not much to look at or anything. I was able to bring one into [Kdenlive] and EQ away some staticy bits that were making it incredibly annoying to listen to atleast. Still there are many artifacts and I will probably experiment with removing them if possible.
* Had my first interview since ~~becoming an unemployed person~~ starting the job search. I thought it went well but two days later I received a nicely worded rejection.
* Sent in a few more job applications.
* Spent more time removing duplicate photos from my collection using [digiKam]. Apple Photos really did a number on them so now I'm just trying to make sense of it all. There has to be a faster way for this so I'm open to suggestions.
* Wrote and published my longest post to date about my [work history] on my non-anniversary date of 6/2.
* Found my old livejournal and deleted it but not before I saved off one post that will be coming out soon.
* Experimented with different ways to post reviews of various media and fell back on adding extra front matter to the markdown posts for now. We'll see if a more sophisticated solution is warranted.
* Felt miserable yesterday so I spent it mostly on the couch.
* Setting up the draft for next week in the hopes that I have more to report then.

* Sent in a few more job applications.
* Completed removing duplicate photos from my collection using [digiKam]. I'm sure I missed something but this is going to be it for now. I removed thousands of duplicate images which is why it has taken so long. Don't be like me.
* Went to the Birthday Party for my niece at Fun City in Lansing. It was good to see the family and the kids in a place they can run around and have fun.
* Took Leah to have surgery, Noah to therapy, and went to Coney Island to celebrate.
* Bought a travel pillow and a hat for traveling.
* Did some laundry and house cleaning.
* I've been playing Overwatch 2 and trying to get my drives.
* Been watching Clarkson's Farm with Leah and we both really enjoy it.
* Watched Companion which I have some thoughts I'm putting together.

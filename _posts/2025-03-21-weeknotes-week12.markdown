_It's week one of my [12 Week Year] but it's the 12th week of the year so I'm calling it week 12. This is meant to be forward looking to a week note for every week of the year._

* I updated my resume to showcase my experience, skills, and accomplishments as a Product Owner.
* Signed up at [NextJob] to take advantage of that benefit from my previous employer.
* Scheduled a meeting with a job coach for next week.
* Updated [my LinkedIn profile] and added a few people that I previously worked with in the past.
* Originally planned to apply to a few jobs this week but have been saving them for next week and a better resume.
* Started documenting some specific projects I've had at work over the last few years.
* Set resume/cv to appear in the main navigation.

It's been a while since I've updated dependencies for this site so I decided to ensure that all the dependencies are updated.  The fact that this site uses [Gulp] which requires [NPM] makes updating the dependencies very easy.

The image above includes a command for updating the version of various dependencies contained within this projects package.json file.


[Gulp]:         http://gulpjs.com/
[NPM]:          http://npmjs.com/

My blog has [Mastodon] powered comments now and this post is really just a test for that.

<!--more-->

This is almost completely the [Cassidy James] implementation of comments via Mastodon. Although I do have plans to do some more specific styling for this site it works well as is. Don't have much more to say about it other than thanks to Mr. James and if you're interested in adding Mastodon comments to your site I've linked to Cassidy's post about it.

I may go back and add comments to previous posts but for now this post will be the only one with comments. The implementation requires an API call with reference to an existing post on Mastodon and I'm not sure if I want to be posting about previous entries in this blog.

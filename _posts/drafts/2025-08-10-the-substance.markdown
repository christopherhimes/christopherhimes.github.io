The Substance is a film from 2024.
It is a body horror film.
That comments on.
Largely on the female body.
Thank you.
It uses body horror to explore the things that women do to themselves.
In the hopes of attaining unrealistic body expectations. Thank you. Yeah.
A lot has been said. Oh yeah, I guess Bastion.
A lot has been said about this film, so I don't want to run down the whole...
Breakdown of the film, but I will say this is another one of those films that is absolutely worth watching. Assuming that you're at least somewhat comfortable with body horror stuff, I wouldn't tell just anybody to watch this film. The cinematography throughout is spectacular, but like the early stuff where just the way it's shot and the the film.
Are you fucking kidding me? Okay. Just the way it's shot.
Make it actually you know what hold on just the way it shot um.

I hate to compare one movie to another movie, although I guess I do that all the time. This felt a little bit Neon Demon. It felt a little bit Society, of all things.
Some of the...
Some of the things in the film just seem to reference other films, which is not a bad thing. I thought the long shot in the hallway with the unique carpet definitely reminded me of The Shining, for example.
I think the performances in this are incredible, and I can't.
It's one of those movies that...
If you just described it to somebody, not knowing that it's an actual thing that exists, you wouldn't believe that it has. It's...
An incredibly an incredible looking film which apparently only cost 18 million dollars that's insane people who spent it when you see a movie that's 100 million dollars and it looks worse than this you should feel bad because this was incredible and it it looks fantastic um.
The performance is, again, fantastic. The...
The body horror aspect of it, the art behind all of the creature work, the body horror design, is very, very good. I mean, it's one of those things where, like...
I don't think it's the point that you're supposed to feel like this is... Uh...
That this is real. Like, it is convincing enough to gross you out, but it is not, like, it doesn't feel real to me. I'm sure people disagree with that. But I don't think that's the point. I think it's meant to be...
Sure. But it's meant to be.
Over the top in a lot of aspects. I think this is one of them. I think the reason, it's not because they failed to make it look realistic. It looks the way it does because that's the intention. And the number of places where you're watching this and the intention of it, everything that you see feels very intentional. So.
I don't know. I just thought that that was really impressive all around. So, very enjoyable. One thing I did want to mention about this film is there are good portions of this film that you should absolutely not watch while you're eating food. I've heard people have their stomachs have been turned while watching this film. So, I think it's best to avoid it, especially in the latter half of it. I decided in the last half hour to eat lunch, and I had a couple pieces of pizza. I don't recommend that to other people. I was fine, but I don't expect that for other folks.

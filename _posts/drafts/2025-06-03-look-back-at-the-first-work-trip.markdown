I randomly thought about Livejournal today. Went to see if mine was still up and sure enough it's 22 years old now and going strong. Just for fun I skimmed through some of the old posts and really enjoyed this one about my first work trip. I'm not on Facebook anymore so I'm going to include some of the mentioned photos at the end of this post.

It begins here (posted on 7/21/2008):

Before you continue I just want you to know that this may be the least angsty post that you have ever read by me. :)

The past few weeks have been amazing. I spent the month of May substitute teaching. This went pretty well all things considered. It took about two weeks after getting hired before I actually got to do any teaching and during that time I had at times considered what it would have went to school for math education. For a while in college I was thinking of getting a math degree and going on to graduate school for a masters and phd, with the intent of teaching at the college level. That whole course of action seemed like a long and difficult road. I believed I could do it. Eventually I decided that I was getting a math degree but I was not going to go any further. Partially because I could do it partially because I liked it, but that partially wasn't as much as I needed to want to complete that task of going that long route.

I subbed in the East Detroit Public School system. I worked in both middle schools, the high school as well as Kellwood. The kids in all of the classes were about on par as what I remembered. I didn't try to befriend the kids and I didn't talk down to them. I think they responded pretty well to that. It's not something I would want to do full time but it gave me something to do for a month as well as a bit of a paycheck.

On June 2nd I started working for Milliken Millwork where my title is technically Software Developer. Since I am the lone software developer I have adopted the nonofficial title of Senior Software Developer, but since I have no one beneath me it is a strange thing to say. Well that and the fact that I have been working there for under 2 months with no previous software development experience.

Work has been going extremely well. Milliken, as the people there refer to it, is a family owned milling wholesale distributor. They are located in Sterling Heights and I can make it there in fifteen minutes. The attire is business casual the hours are good and the pay is nothing to scoff at. I am able to stay at home and save up some money, save quite a bit of money in fact. I did splurge on a camera but I did get a good deal, so that's all well and good. It's a family owned business which has its benefits and its drawbacks. Benefits are the small work atmosphere, easy going attitude, etc. The drawbacks all seem to be in communication and nervousness. Basically what I mean is I feel like they are taking a fairly slow pace with the amount of responsibility they give me. I suppose this might be a good thing in a long run but to use a metaphor I'm kinda chomping at the bit to get to work on something.

Oh, and I just got back from Oregon and California. Sunday, I returned from my first business trip. I left on the 13th flying first to San Francisco, CA then hopping on a connecting flight to Klamath Falls, OR. In Oregon the IT manager and I met with the people at JELD-WEN, where they spent the week teaching me how to work their catalog. I am going to be the driving force behind any new additional updates to Milliken's catalog as well as charged with creating new catalogs... Thursday of last week Mark the IT manager and I drove out to Crater Lake which is really beautiful. We had a really great dinner in the cabin on the lake at sunset. I took some pictures with that camera I mentioned earlier which I've posted on the Facebook. They're pretty.

Friday after work we flew back to San Francisco and checked into our hotel rooms there. Then we took the shuttle to the airport then the train into San Francisco. We wandered around China Town and finally grabbed some late night Chinese food that was delicious. We took the train home which was pretty eventful. There was a guy and a really drunk or something girl. She was being loud and crazy and some guys in the back were laughing at her. So the guy she was with stood up and threatened them and cursing them. Then he threatened everyone on the train and the conductor, a little asian man, had to come out and ask if he needed to leave. He opted to stay and a stop later his girl opted to throw-up on the train.

Saturday we went downtown again and walked forever... All the sites that I saw are documented on Facebook. It was a long day of a lot of walking. We had lunch on the pier that consisted of sourdough bread bowls. The day ended on a red eye flight home. Other pretty ok things happened but really about halfway through the day I wanted to be home. On the red eye flight I had planned on getting some sleep but the lady next to me read for 3 1/2 of the 4 1/2 hour flight. It kinda sucked and I was super fidgety and agitated by the whole situation. I couldn't read and I couldn't seem to stand to listen to any music. It seemed even longer than it was.

Early Sunday we arrived and I realized just how sun burnt I was. My eyes hurt from the sun and I was tired and quiet. Later in the day Matthew took me to see The Dark Knight for my birthday. It was sweet of him and well the movie was excellent. The movie might not live up to all the hype but Heath Ledgers performance. I kept asking myself how super hero movie acting could get oscar hype. I understand it now and it makes complete sense now. I get it, I concur, I want to see it again. I do not repeat movies in the theater but this is different. This performance must have been extremely physically demanding and I'm not talking about physicality. This is the most realistic portrayal of any comic book character I have ever seen. It puts the character into the realm of reality and that's what makes the character so scary. I've seen a few films with Heath Ledger in them and during the movie I kept forgetting it was him. I didn't feel like it was him saying the lines or acting the part. He gave the character a life of its own if i dare say with the risk of being cliche. Frankly it's acting like that which give credibility to that cliche.

Frankly I'm spent and should already be in bed. I will try not to type so much next time. Possibly updating more often is in the works? I always say that and it always falls through. Oh well... I hope all is well with everyone.

There it is in all its glory. I kept all the ugly in there as well.

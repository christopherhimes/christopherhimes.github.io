__What I'm doing now__

Updated March 22, 2025

### Personal
Leah and I have booked AirBNB's and we're still going to France.

My position at JELD-WEN was eliminated and I was let go on 3/13/25. So, the job search begins!

### Movies/TV
Just finished Severance and this season hits a little different now. Dylan is literally rejected by a door company in the second episode.
Also, we've just finished the latest seasons of Traitors and Traitors UK. Those UK folks played a really fun game.

### Music
I've still been listening to the Wicked soundtrack and the new Kendrick album. There has also been a bit of indie rock in there again.

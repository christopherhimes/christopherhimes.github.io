This site was originally registered in 2011. It has seen a number of different iterations but has seen the most activity within the last year.

* This site is built using [Jekyll] a static site generator that uses [Markdown] and [Liquid] to create modern websites. 
* I use [Netlify] for hosting.
* The site repository is hosted on [Github]. Although I'm open to changing this in the future.
* Domain hosting through [namecheap].
* The [now] page uses the [last.fm] API to retrieve the recent played song.
* Comments are tied to [my] posts on [Mastodon] using a setup similar to the one made by [Cassidy].
* Development is completed in [VSCodium] a de-microfted version of [VSCode].
* In an attempt to avoid [Google Fonts] I have included the Lato font in the assets for the site.
* Just added [Umami] to test out their analytics.

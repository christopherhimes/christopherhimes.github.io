I'm a developer living in Metro Detroit - using my experience to make complicated things seem effortless, simpler, and elegant.

I'm a jack of all trades, master of none. I've worked with C++, Objective-C, PHP, MySQL, jQuery, and many more standards.

With a strong Mathematics and Computer Science background I'm always ready to work through a problem logically.

Focusing on more than just code, design to me means both form and function.

Some of the most interesting things to learn in both Development and Design are taking place on the web.

_I really need to get someone to write this section for me. Either that or invest in a stick figure with a hard had animated gif_

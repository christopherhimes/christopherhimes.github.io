  <li>Once in Paris we didn’t have to pick up any luggage so we went right to get a taxi to the Hilton at the airport. This is the only hotel we stayed at on the trip.</li>
  <li>By the time we got to the hotel it was 10:30 so we dropped stuff at the room and grabbed something from the restaurant there before it closed.</li>
  <li>We needed to be back at the airport for a 9 AM flight so we called it a night.</li>
  <li>Woke up and had continental breakfast at 6 AM, with some pain au chocolat, fruits, eggs, and espresso. The spread here was pretty impressive.</li>
  <li>There was some drama about taxis from other guests abut we got to the airport just fine. The international terminal was crowded so we actually got out of the taxi early and walked the rest of the way there.</li>
  <li>Made it through security and to the gate in plenty of time. Only gave ourselves 2 hours to get there but that was plenty. This flight was delayed too for reasons I do not know. Also we needed to go to the counter and do an additional security check. This was the first time hearing my name on PA at an airport though so that’s something.</li>
  <li>Flight was 9 hours long but didn’t seem that long honestly. Watched some movies had some food and listened to some music.</li>
  <li>Once in Detroit we got through customs no problem and grabbed our luggage. It was weird to drive after two weeks but we got home fine. Got home and unpacked a little but mostly pet our cats.</li>
  <li>Tuesday I went and picked up Tater from my parents and Matthew and I went to the Run the Jewels and Wu-Tang Clan concert.</li>
  <li>The rest of the week has been about recovering from the 6 hour difference and enjoying time before Leah starts work on Monday.</li>
  <li>The copy of Amelie I reserved at the library came in and Leah and I watched it today.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is day 28  of #100DaysToOffload.</p>

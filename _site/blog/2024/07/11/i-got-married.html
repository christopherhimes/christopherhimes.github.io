There are threats at the moment that Etsy is going in a bad direction but we’ve been very happy with the vendors we found.

It was late enough in the year that everything was green and some flowers had bloomed. It was a small ceremony and dinner with just close family.

<p>It’s been a little over a month now since I got married.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>First of all the planning had been going on for a few years and I’m happy to say everything went really well. We benefitted greatly by having the entire event in one location. <a href="https://www.thewhitney.com/">The Whitney</a> is a really nice venue with an outdoor location for the ceremony and delicious food.</p>

<p>We managed to find lots of great inspiration on Pinterest and vendors on Etsy. There are threats at the moment that Etsy is going in a bad direction but we’ve been very happy with the vendors we found. We spent way too long considering invitations but managed to pick out just about everything else very quickly. It was really nice to know that when planning something my wife and I were so in sync.</p>

<p>We had a first look in the library with just us and her son.The ceremony was in the garden where the weather was warm for May but sunny. It was late enough in the year that everything was green and some flowers had bloomed. It was a small ceremony and dinner with just close family.</p>

<p>Photos took a long time but we’re really happy with the result. I’ve updated my socials with a solo image from the day which I like quite a bit. We’ve got a book being printed and we are going to pick out at least one image to frame.</p>

<p>After the wedding we stayed downtown at <a href="https://www.thedetroitclub.com/">The Detroit Club</a> which was a bit fancy but the stay was relaxing. We were within walking distance of a Starbucks and we booked a spa day. The Movement festival was happening downtown so when we rode the People Mover there were some interesting folks making their way around town.</p>

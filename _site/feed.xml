        <title>Week 23</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Converted the VHS tapes I had planned to at the library. They were pretty degraded so they’re not much to look at or anything. I was able to bring one into &lt;a href=&quot;https://kdenlive.org/&quot;&gt;Kdenlive&lt;/a&gt; and EQ away some staticy bits that were making it incredibly annoying to listen to atleast. Still there are many artifacts and I will probably experiment with removing them if possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Had my first interview since &lt;del&gt;becoming an unemployed person&lt;/del&gt; starting the job search. I thought it went well but two days later I received a nicely worded rejection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sent in a few more job applications.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spent more time removing duplicate photos from my collection using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digikam.org/&quot;&gt;digiKam&lt;/a&gt;. Apple Photos really did a number on them so now I’m just trying to make sense of it all. There has to be a faster way for this so I’m open to suggestions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wrote and published my longest post to date about my &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2025/06/02/work-history&quot;&gt;work history&lt;/a&gt; on my non-anniversary date of 6/2.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Found my old livejournal and deleted it but not before I saved off one post that will be coming out soon.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experimented with different ways to post reviews of various media and fell back on adding extra front matter to the markdown posts for now. We’ll see if a more sophisticated solution is warranted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Felt miserable yesterday so I spent it mostly on the couch.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setting up the draft for next week in the hopes that I have more to report then.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is day 22  of #100DaysToOffload.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Work History</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if it is nostalgia or what but I’ve spent the past few weeks thinking about my previous employment. Maybe it’s just a consequence of job searching while between jobs that will do that to a person. One thing it has taught me is to do a better job of making notes about what you’re doing in the moment. I’m sure I’ve forgot something or will be tweaking this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won’t do this non-anniversary thing again but today would have been 17 years at Milliken Millwork/MMI Door/JELD-WEN. There’s a lot that happened over that time and this is no way a list of it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2008&quot;&gt;2008&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start June 2nd - Milliken Millwork.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Product training and onboarding.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trip to Klamath, OR for training from the developers at JELD-WEN.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Initial catalog build was for Home Depot and it was created by JELD-WEN and the marketing department.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Had to go to Atlanta to test the catalog at THD’s headquarters. Stage environment testing took place on-site and would continue for both retailers for years.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After returning from training work began on bug fixes via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trackit.com/&quot;&gt;Track-IT&lt;/a&gt; and setup to support another retailer. We were already building out support for Lowe’s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2009&quot;&gt;2009&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Early in the year the Milliken retail catalog is available at both major retailers. Lowe’s required breaking up the roll out by store and product category (Exterior, Interior, Patio).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wrote a program in Visual Studio 6.0 to monitor a folder that would periodically receive EDI orders. Orders were parsed into Excel documents for formatting purposes, they were then sent to a local printer, and both EDI and Excel files were archived.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added a Tax Credit question to the catalog and all the filtering necessary to hide products that did not meet the Energy Star requirements which disqualified the items from the credit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updates happened more slowly at this time and we were largely just resolving issues without adding anything major to the experience. This was a time that everything offered appeared in the printed price pages. A simpler time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not sure if it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2010&quot;&gt;2010&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added Commercial Doors to the offering. A brand new offering to the company and the largest addition I made to the catalog to date. Since this category is heavy on hardware additional layers were added to visualization to include exit devices, closers, and kick plates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Built a revamped website with branding similar to the new price pages which were also launching. The site included links to brochures, the usual business site pages (About, Locations, Careers), and a combination Dealer Login and Quick Order Info Search. None of the forms work but you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20100517114144/http://millikenmillwork.com/&quot;&gt;still see most of it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Quick Order Info Search was probably the best thing about the site at this time. A customer could go to the site with a purchase order number and their Zip code and see the status of the order. This prevented a call in these situations which mean customer service could be dedicated to new business and resolving issues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Dealer Login was a fully custom secure area with registration, password management, and the ability to review all pending orders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2011&quot;&gt;2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Worked with a website company to build &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20111120183229/http://www.millikenmillwork.com/&quot;&gt;a new site&lt;/a&gt; with products listed. Using the data from the retail configurators, and enriching it with customer facing terms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Built a configurator using jquery to allow for custom configurations based on the same data set that drove the main site. Additional information was added to offer painting, staining, and hardware items not mentioned in the general site.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Site also included a dealer locator that required geocoding dealer’s addresses and connecting to google map API to determine location relative to zip or address provided. The distance calculated took into account the curvature of the earth which still amuses me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2012&quot;&gt;2012&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Home Depot was switching to WTS Paradigm so I spent a week in Atlanta learning the new software. When I got back immediately got started building out the new catalog with the help of a consultant.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Milliken decided to switch to a new ERP system called Ponderosa by Computer Associates Inc (CAi). Flew out with a small team to Rhode Island on the company plane. There we had a week long training session about building the product configurator.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I believe this is about the time we brought on another developer to keep maintenance running on the existing catalogs while the new Home Depot catalog was being built. We needed more developers at this point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2013&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once we got back from training with CAi I got started documenting the required setup within the configurator. Infrastructure was still coming so the first few months were outlining the relationships between answers to ensure the system only offered valid combinations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most of the year was spent ensuring items were populated into Ponderosa and that they were utilized in the product configurator.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The timeline was aggressive for a customer facing solution so the initial setup also included image based answers for the web as well as a dynamic visualization of the configured unit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stom Doors were added to the offering and were added to both retail catalogs and the website.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Milliken acquired a Millwork company headquartered out of Lancaster, PA so I spent a few days there learning about their setup and offering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2014&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Was made the Lead Software Developer in March and made it official that other developers were reporting to me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No joke, we went live with Ponderosa on April 1st. The first part of the year was spent testing go-live critical configurator items. We had a principal develelopment completion date of the end of 2013 so we were squashing bugs and preparing the items that would launch after the initial go-live.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As part of the setup of the configurator I proposed, and CAi implemented, new functionality to their configurator product to enable the filtering of answers based on previous answers to questions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since the Ponderosa configurator is mostly freely typed text I built a number of reports to validate consistency.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prior to going live with the new Ponderosa web portal the existing portal utilized both the order data from Prism (the old ERP) and used the API from Ponderosa so no interruption took place for the customer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After go-live we focused on getting the web portal for dealers ready to launch. I believe we went live with what they branded as MMI Design in October with the first high priority customers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At launch we had product visualization that would apply the customer’s paint or stain options to the product they were building. It took almost 7 years before the same would be true for the retail catalogs in a way that was a reasonable representation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2015&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added another developer bringing the team to three.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maintaining projects through Trello.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added 14k special order interior doors to the catalog utilizing ImageMagick for manipulating thousands of unique images.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added catalog support for selling to Menards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transitioned to local hosting for retail catalog including build management and admin duties.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wrote an Excel based application for the enrichment of e-commerce items for Home Depot online sales. Enabled marketing to maintain their enrichment materials in Excel and run the program that would fill out the documents they needed to send back. This removed copy and paste errors while also saving them hours per batch of products they were onboarding.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using the data in Ponderosa, I built a PHP script to extract the table and item data. From there it was enriched and relationships were established via a series of tables built to supply additional business logic that would have normally been provided by what Ponderosa calls dependencies. All this was used to populate the product offering and custom configurations offered on DoorBuy.com which launched in October.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Menards releases the first Milliken catalog into all their stores on December 24th.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Met my future wife!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2016&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added another developer bringing the team to four.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helped with building a scaled back version of DoorBuy.com to be used as MMIDoor.com.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Worked with CAi to define a tool that will utilize the Ponderosa configurator to create items for use with e-commerce. This dramatically increases the number of items that can be created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2017&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;August 25th JELD-WEN acquires Milliken Millwork and MMI Door is born. I don’t recall the use of the MMI Door until the acquisition was announced and I cannot find anything announcing the name. It just shows up in the press release although they had started using email addresses with @mmidoor.com as early as July 2016.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;JELD-WEN immediately pulls the plug on DoorBuy.com.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2018&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added two Junior Developers bringing the team to six.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Worked with operations and pricing to adjust the way list prices are calculated. This resulted in a 60% reduction in the total number of priced items in the retail catalogs and made it faster to go to market for all customer facing prices (Brochures, Price Pages, Retail Catalogs).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is a massive undertaking and requires adjusting the pricing in the ERP as well as the retail catalogs at Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Menards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To better align with other departments we begin managing project releases and communication through Basecamp.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Both Junior Developers leave and are not replaced 😢.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remaining experienced developers leave or give notice. Scramble to get approval to start the hiring process so we’re not back to just me with three retail catalogs, an ERP configurator, website, EDI automation, and e-commerce support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2019&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Traveled to the Home Depot headquarters to discuss configurator future plans. Peers attended virtually with no problem 🤷.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Worked with CAi to build an EDI automation program for retail catalog orders. These orders come over as a series of questions and answers and this new tool matches up the QA from the retail catalogs with the corresponding QA that live in the Ponderosa configurator. This eliminates the need for customer service to hand enter each of these custom orders.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Move ticketing and release management to ServiceNow. Transition away from Basecamp and Track-IT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2020&quot;&gt;2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Like many others we go virtual full time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complete a few price increase releases as costs are very volatile.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Twice during the year spend a week on furlow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lowe’s announces they are going to switch from Syndigo’s m2o and join Menards and Home Depot on WTS Paradigm. We work to schedule all that work for a release in the middle of 2021.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MMI team starts helping with ABS Talon catalog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2021&quot;&gt;2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complete required standard changes and a phased release of the MMI catalog at Lowe’s.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some standard updates for Lowe’s are nice enhancements and can be shared with other retailers so they see some quality of life changes up on their next release as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Previous Product Owner for JELD-WEN doors announces his retirement and I put my hat in the ring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2022&quot;&gt;2022&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The year of EDS 2.0. Each catalog needed to be upgraded to achieve Lowe’s updated standards. This represented a significant change to the base setup of the product and could not really be done in phases.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We also made changes to offer catalogs on the Vendo version of the Paradigm software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2023&quot;&gt;2023&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launched the F-4500 folding door, Fiberglass line discontinuation, black hinge addition, and did some cut down tests in select markets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WAVE project with the McKinsey group started in late October.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2024&quot;&gt;2024&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Year of WAVE initiatives starting with a complete revamp of the Exterior Door catalog with an emphasis on modern marketing materials and a quicker time to quote.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mid-year saw the roll out of the updated Exterior catalog and the beginning of reworked pricing rolling out into the Exterior and Interior catalogs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once we were on to final testing with the JELD-WEN catalogs we turned our attention to the American Building Supply (ABS) catalogs for simplification and to improve the order entry experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2025&quot;&gt;2025&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lowes.com launches interior configurable products where the retail catalog appears in stores for both JELD-WEN and ABS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;End March 13th.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Posted this recap on June 2nd which is 17 years from my start date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I have more that I want to add in recent years but I think it can wait for now. Not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is day 21  of #100DaysToOffload.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 22</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Went to the farmer’s market and at 8 am it was already bumpin.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Bought starters for tomatoes, green bell peppers, cucumbers, and zuchinnis (cukes and zukes as the kids are saying).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Got two lantanas for my wife. She really loves the small bursts of colors.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Picked us up some starbys ⭐☕ on the way home.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Planted the starters I got from the farmer’s market as well as some seeds I had from last year. These included lettuce, spinach, beans, peas, carrots, onions, chives, tarragon, and sunflowers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doing any kinda gardening directly under an established tree is a bit of a nightmare. I have two garbage cans full of tree roots if you’re interested.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Split some hostas to add more to the freshly mulched front landscaping.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve been on a tear digitizing our DVD collections using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.makemkv.com/&quot;&gt;MakeMKV&lt;/a&gt;. I’m through mine and have made a sizable dent in Leah’s. I’m also using &lt;a href=&quot;https://handbrake.fr/&quot;&gt;HandBrake&lt;/a&gt; to make the files a bit more manageable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I added accounts for Leah and Noah within &lt;a href=&quot;jellyfin.org&quot;&gt;Jellyfin&lt;/a&gt; so we can have our own watch history.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pulled out the webmention work for the time being as I haven’t gotten it to a good point as of yet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Took an assessment an was able to schedule an initial interview next week which is nice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Made an appointment at the library to convert a VHS tape to digital. They have a media lab and have a number of devices for converting media.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spent some time removing duplicate photos from my collection using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digikam.org/&quot;&gt;digiKam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updated meta data for my music files using &lt;a href=&quot;https://picard.musicbrainz.org/&quot;&gt;MusicBrainz Picard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wrote a bit of a a lengthy post I will be publishing on 6/2.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m backdating this post please forgive me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is day 20  of #100DaysToOffload.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 21</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pulled weeds and double turned the garden beds in advance of planting the vegetable garden.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cleaned up the back yard, removing old leaves overgrown trees along the fence, and sweeping out the trampoline.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Made more changes to the resume removing some uses of the word ‘product’ to focus more on product ownership rather than the product that was represented in the retail catalog.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bought an external CD/DVD drive to start digitalizing some items. I’ve been in a chicken 🐔 or the egg 🥚 situation with getting a NAS so I’m going to use some free time to put together the media that would fill out the library. I’m using the beta Linux version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.makemkv.com/&quot;&gt;MakeMKV&lt;/a&gt; for this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Installed and setup &lt;a href=&quot;jellyfin.org&quot;&gt;Jellyfin&lt;/a&gt; on my computer. This required updating the /etc/fstab file as I had some user specific items in there that was preventing Jellyfin from detecting the existing media. After that it was an easy setup and connection to the apps on both my phone and Roku.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spent some time experimenting with Webmentions. I have a blog post in my drafts folder but I haven’t decided on the exact implementation just yet. I did run a test and confirm it works I just haven’t written all I want to say just yet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TODAY IS MY ONE YEAR WEDDING ANNIVERSARY! 🎉&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is day 19  of #100DaysToOffload.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 20</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Completed the CSPO class and am now a Cetrified Scrum Product Owner with Scrum Alliance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spent a bunch of time in the yard. I’ve got 8 paper bags and four garbage cans full of yard waste this week. I’m exhausted 😴&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trimmed hops up a few feet to make it easy to maintain the few main line.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attended my sister’s commencements in Mt. Peazy over a week ago now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mother’s Day activities at Le Crepe and Sedona.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Painted with a twist.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So, I get this text from my wife, “It’s all or nothing…” We’re watching the latest Married at First Sight on Netflix.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More True Blood. 🩸&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is day 18  of #100DaysToOffload.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Accessibility Day 2025</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;May 15th 2025 was &lt;a href=&quot;https://accessibility.day/&quot;&gt;Accessibility Day&lt;/a&gt;. I started this post on the day but wasn unable to complete it in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wave.webaim.org&quot;&gt;WAVE&lt;/a&gt; test and was happy with the results on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;blogimg&quot; alt=&quot;Zero errors on the accessibility test.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://christopherhimes.com/assets/img//blog/accessibility/score.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot more to consider and I’ll be working that into the ongoing changes here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is day 17  of #100DaysToOffload.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 19</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Applied to some jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Posted last weeks week notes late.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Took some Coursera classes. I’m currently on a DevOps section of the Scrum Master concentration.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Signed up for the CSPO class next week!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Took some practice tests for the PSPO certification.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weather was nice yesterday so I spent a few hours on the yard. Cut the grass for the first time this year, trimmed the bushes, and did more cleanup.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hops are really doing well with all the rain so I moved their lines to the top of the sunroom.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updated resume on this site.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting ready for my sister’s commencements tomorrow in Mt. Peazy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Very briefly got through my RSS feed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More True Blood. 🩸&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Listening to whatever comes next after 🎵 Poison Oak - Bright Eyes on Spotify.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is day 16  of #100DaysToOffload.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 18</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Applied to some jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Revisited the lighthouse score for this site and &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2025/04/29/lighthouse-revisited&quot;&gt;posted about it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;🎥 Saw Sinners in IMAX with my brother. This is a movie that sticks with you afterward and definitely worth checking out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Created &lt;a href=&quot;/hundred&quot;&gt;/hundred&lt;/a&gt; a dedicated page for 100 Days To Offload posts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Created a plugin for jekyll in ruby to count the number of pages for 100 Days To Offload and &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2025/04/30/100-day-progress-page&quot;&gt;wrote about it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updated the code highlighter for this site so future posts that include code will be easier to read.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added Open Graph images that are automatically generated when a post is created.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;🍿 watched A Complete Unknown the Bob Dylan movie with my wife. It was an enjoyable watch with Timothee Chalamet doing some incredible work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Took my wife to urgent care and eventually we missed her graduation to have surgery. Whether she walked or not she’s just completed her Master’s in Social Work and I’m so proud of her.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Marathoned the first season and a half of True Blood with my wife while she recovered from surgery.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Late posting this because I’ve been taking care of my wife..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is day 15  of #100DaysToOffload.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hi there</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m Christopher Himes, an accomplished Product Owner seeking new opportunities for transformation and adding value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on adding generated open graph images to the site. I think they’re in a good place at the moment but they only apply to blog posts. In order to create a generic one for the site as a whole I wanted to have a simple post that would create one with the correct content. So, that’s what you’re looking at here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry there is not more here but stay tuned for the details on getting the open graph image together that is coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image associated with this blog post in open graph is also the one associated with any non-blog page on the site. I think it makes it a little nicer. Not that anyone is sharing my &lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; section but the the proof of concept is neat anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is day 14  of #100DaysToOffload.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Updated Code Block Styling</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Really didn’t like the look of code on the previous post. This has been on the &lt;a href=&quot;/todo&quot;&gt;todo&lt;/a&gt; list and I just went ahead and made it happen today. Now code is styled using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge&quot;&gt;rouge&lt;/a&gt; and monokai styling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of html formatting with line numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;marquee&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello World!&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/marquee&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a result of the impressive code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;marquee&gt;Hello World!&lt;/marquee&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was implemented by updating the _config.yml for the site like so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;markdown: kramdown
kramdown:
  input: GFM
  syntax_highlighter: rouge
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the inclusion of styling css in the header.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;rel=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;stylesheet&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;/assets/css/syntax_monokai.css&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;media=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;print&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;onload=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;this.onload=null;this.removeAttribute(&apos;media&apos;);&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;fetchpriority=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;low&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a lot to get it readable which is nice. I’m done with same day changes now I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is day 13  of #100DaysToOffload.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dedicated 100 Days To Offload Progress Page</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This one feels a bit like padding but I wanted to post it anyway. I have a few things in mind with the blog but I wanted to test the waters a bit with a dedicated page to the progress of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://100daystooffload.com/&quot;&gt;100 Days To Offload&lt;/a&gt; challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve added a &lt;a href=&quot;/hundred&quot;&gt;hundred&lt;/a&gt; page that will list out all the available posts that have been tagged with ‘100 Days To Offload.’ I’ve removed pagination, descriptions, tags, etc. and will just be presenting the number in the series, title, and original post date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This of course is not an essential page for the site but what I wanted to focus on with its creation is filtering blog posts with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki&quot;&gt;liquid&lt;/a&gt;. Which again is the template engine used by &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and others for generating static pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of publishing this post the &lt;a href=&quot;/hundred&quot;&gt;hundred&lt;/a&gt; page is generated using the following code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-liquid&quot; data-lang=&quot;liquid&quot;&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

      &amp;lt;a href=&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; - &lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;%B %d, %Y&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
    &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;endfor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since CSS supports using emoji for classes I had to go ahead and use 💯 to remove the bullets and padding from this unordered list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;💯&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;list-style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;padding-left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it was fun anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about having an existing tag with posts is that I can use this to experiment with loading pages prior to getting into the next project which is putting together a portfolio of sorts. With the right filtering and tagging the portfolio can be generated based on blog posts rather than a brand new construction. I’m sure I will need to populate these upcoming posts with more details to better support a more visual presentation that I have planned for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a bit torn between the simplicity of the site currently and wanting to have some more visual representation. The trade off for now will be a portfolio section that is a bit more visual while keeping most of the site simple. I’m not a front-end developer but I would like to add something here that is a bit more engaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also went ahead and updated every post in this series so I don’t have to keep track of which post is which. Now each post includes a tag number that can be referenced as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-liquid&quot; data-lang=&quot;liquid&quot;&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;This is day &lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;tag_numbers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;100 Days To Offload&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;  of #100DaysToOffload.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each post within a series does not know how many other posts are in that series. Because of this a plugin was required to make this happen. Here is the plugin that I created to enable this functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sorted_posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;each_with_index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;tag_numbers&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;tag_numbers&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One downside to this is that GitHub Pages will not support this plugin but I use Netlify so that should not be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing about this site that I’m not happy with is I don’t have the necessary tests in place to ensure changes meet the standard of quality I want. Case in point, a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2024/07/26/lighthouse&quot;&gt;few months back&lt;/a&gt; I got the site to a good &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse&quot;&gt;lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; score. Not just good, the site was at 100% for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO on desktop. Mobile had 95% for performance and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;desktop-original&quot;&gt;Desktop (original)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;blogimg&quot; alt=&quot;Past lighthouse scores of 100% in all categories&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://christopherhimes.com/assets/img//blog/lighthouse/lighthouse-desktop.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mobile-original&quot;&gt;Mobile (original)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;blogimg&quot; alt=&quot;Past lighthouse scores of 100% in all categories but performance and accessibility at 95%&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://christopherhimes.com/assets/img//blog/lighthouse/lighthouse-mobile.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had not rerun the lighthouse test in a while. The recent run was not good as pictured below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;blogimg&quot; alt=&quot;Recent light mode scores with 87% for performance, 95% for accessibility, and 100% for best practices and SEO&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://christopherhimes.com/assets/img//blog/lighthouse-revisited/lighthouse-score-current.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing that jumps out, and maybe it’s because it’s in &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;, is the “Largest Contentful Paint element”. My face apparently is just too big. To address this I resized the image to match the dimension it will be displayed. Just to be sure I introduced a little bit of lossy compression using cwebp in the command line. Not enough that you should notice but just enough to reduce the file size a little more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cwebp -q 85 new-face-325x325.webp -o home-face-325x325.webp
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there I got a lower score than before with the report saying the image was low resolution and it was expecting something around 488 pixels square. I ended up resolving this issue by starting over and providing an image of 650x650 for the 325x325 square. This appears to be a requirement for serving to higher density screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I did find interesting is that it appears lighthouse is using the light mode as a default. This of course exposes that I did not do enough testing of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/color-contrast&quot;&gt;color contrast&lt;/a&gt; when setting up the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2025/04/16/light-and-dark-revisited&quot;&gt;light mode&lt;/a&gt;. Based on the feedback from the contrast test I’ve updated the light mode to the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;box white&quot;&gt;rgb(240,240,240)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;box medium-green&quot;&gt;rgb(0, 87, 59)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;box medium-blue&quot;&gt;rgb(1, 85, 106)&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;blogimg&quot; alt=&quot;Home page in the latest version of light mode with slightly darker blue and green&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://christopherhimes.com/assets/img//blog/lighthouse-revisited/light-mode-updated.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may expect the dark mode which existed first and was used in the original test meets the contrast requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more thing I did was to shift some css styling to a sheet that is loaded asynchronously versus the inline critical styling. This has been a bit of guess and check on my part and I’m not sure I have everything where it needs to be just yet. If you see any jumps or restyling when a page loads please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing slowing down the site was font awesome icons for email, mastodon, bluesky, RSS feed, and github. I tried a few different ways to speed this up but ultimately went with doing away with the icons altogether. For now it’s kinda nice not having a company’s logo on my site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked through the mobile score first as this is usually the most difficult to get right. The standards are understandably higher due to the variety of devices and connections. The main issue here was the picture of my face which was either too large of a file or low resolution. These things seem like opposites but there is a balancing act between quality images and file size. Ultimately I ended up recreating the image from its source and working with the compression of cwebp to get to a high enough quality image while having a low load time in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the results of these efforts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;desktop&quot;&gt;Desktop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;blogimg&quot; alt=&quot;Desktop Lighthouse score results with all four categories listed at 100%&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://christopherhimes.com/assets/img//blog/lighthouse-revisited/lighthouse-desktop.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mobile&quot;&gt;Mobile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;blogimg&quot; alt=&quot;Mobile Lighthouse score results with all four categories listed at 100%&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://christopherhimes.com/assets/img//blog/lighthouse-revisited/lighthouse-mobile.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit of trial and error both the mobile and desktop versions of the site have 100% for all four categories! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some optional items on the lighthouse page that I would like to pursue as well so this will likely get revisited again. For now things are faster and more people can interact comfortably with the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is day 11  of #100DaysToOffload.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Read Time and Tags</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Having dramatically scaled back this site to make the restyling easier I have been slowly adding back in some removed features. One thing I’ve wanted to enable for a while is making a posts tags visible. I have continued to add tags to posts as they’re going out but that extra bit of information has not been shared anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’ve added to each post on the blog page so anyone visiting the site can see how a post is tagged when deciding whether or not to click into read the whole article. These also appear again once you’ve clicked through to the full post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are the current light and dark mode versions of the current stylings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;blogimg&quot; alt=&quot;Image of the dark version of the Meta and 100 Days to Offload tags associated with this blog post&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://christopherhimes.com/assets/img//blog/read-time-and-tags/tag-dark.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;blogimg&quot; alt=&quot;Image of the dark version of the Meta and 100 Days to Offload tags associated with this blog post&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://christopherhimes.com/assets/img//blog/read-time-and-tags/tag-light.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tags are styled as buttons which when clicked take you to the tag index page. Initially I had the tags slugified&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which didn’t take you to the correct part of the page. This has been removed so each link has a # and should navigate you to the part of the tag index page with similar posts. I am also adding a feature to the &lt;a href=&quot;/todo&quot;&gt;todo&lt;/a&gt; page for related posts using this tagging. As more posts are added the opportunities to link between posts and filter for specific types of posts increases. I think there will be more to come there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another feature I’ve added to the site is a read time calculator. The site is using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mslinn/jekyll_reading_time&quot;&gt;jekyll_reading_time&lt;/a&gt; gem to calculate the average read time of each post. For now I’ve included this information with each post blurb on the blog page as well as at the top of each post. Adding this feature has really highlighted for me that I mostly post short form blog posts. Essentially, each of these could could have just been a tweet/toot (Xitter/Mastodon). The current longest post is about 8 minutes in read time and it’s the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2025/03/24/personality-test&quot;&gt;personality test results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know that I want to be writing novels or anything but I do want to dig into some things more. Thinking that an average of five minutes would be a good amount of time to aim for. That of course is an arbitrary metric and not something I would force. I tend to be overly succinct in my writing so I’ll be working on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are things I’ve liked from other sites I’ve visited and decided to incorporate here. I’m not sure if I like the styling of the tags but that is fairly easy to change. I don’t know if I like the linking or the format of the &lt;a href=&quot;/tags&quot;&gt;tag index page&lt;/a&gt; either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as with everything else around here it’s a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is day 10  of #100DaysToOffload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A slug refers to human readable and URL friendly text like the format of the URL for this post. Often this involves replacing spaces with dashes and removing special characters. The term is carried over from the print world. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Week 17</title>
        <description>&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Applied to some jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Corrected the deprecated warning in the SASS for the @import command used for comments on this site. Switched to @use.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weather ☀️ has been nice so I’ve been working in the yard. The garden beds need some serious care so I’m getting them cleaned up and ready for planting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Had a call about what I’m looking for at a potential employer. Conversation was good but they do not currently have an open position for what I’m looking for. It was nice to talk about my experience either way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Completed the capstone project for the Product Owner IBM certification on Coursera. I don’t usually post to LinkedIn but I did this time. Nice to celebrate a win.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Today was my wife’s late mom’s birthday, so we went to the cemetery to honor her and place some flowers. The irises we planted last year are looking good which is nice. 💐&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is day 9  of #100DaysToOffload.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Product Owner Certification</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Currently between roles and one thing I knew immediately that I wanted to do with the extra time was get a certification. I’ve always been doing more informal self improvement and learning but now seemed like a good time to have a little something to show for it and make it a bit more official.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I jumped into some Product Owner courses on Coursera. This track had seven classes with a few projects that were graded. I did learn a few new strategies for prioritization and negotiation which I plan to discuss over the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss having a team that is building something together but that will come in time. For now I’m bettering myself both because I want to and because it will help with whatever the next thing is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;blogimg&quot; alt=&quot;IBM Product Owner Certification&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://christopherhimes.com/assets/img//blog/ibm-product-owner-certification/cert.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Completed a few lessons on Coursera and started the final project for the IBM Product Owner course.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remained stuck on Cicada Detroit puzzle 20.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Went to Hamtramck with my mom and Josie. Where we got baked goods for Easter from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newpalacebakery.com/&quot;&gt;New Palace Bakery&lt;/a&gt; and had lunch at &lt;a href=&quot;https://polonia-restaurant.net/&quot;&gt;Polonia&lt;/a&gt;. Classic Easter preparation stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drove my wife around on Friday while her car was in the shop again.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Completed &lt;a href=&quot;https://overwatch.blizzard.com&quot;&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/a&gt; drives.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Light and Dark Mode Revisited</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;
.box {
  float: left;
  /* height: 50px; */
  /* width: 50px; */
  padding: 15px;
  text-align: center;
  vertical-align: center;
  margin-bottom: 15px;
  border: 1px solid light-dark(rgb(26, 26, 26), rgb(240,240,240));
  color: black;
  /* clear: both; */
}
.white {background-color: rgb(240,240,240);}
.black {background-color: rgb(26, 26, 26);color:white;}
.medium-green {background-color: rgb(0, 119, 83);}
.bright-green {background-color: rgb(32, 255, 188);}
.medium-blue {background-color: rgb(1, 151, 189);}
.bright-blue {background-color: rgb(25, 209, 255);}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to revisit the light and dark update as the original described some changes but didn’t display how these changes impacted the experience on the site. Now that images are working a bit better I figured I would show exactly what’s happening on the site in its current state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dark mode which is the primary way I view the site uses an almost black background with bright green and blue for the headers and links respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;box black&quot;&gt;rgb(26, 26, 26)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;box bright-green&quot;&gt;rgb(32, 255, 188)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;box bright-blue&quot;&gt;rgb(25, 209, 255)&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;blogimg&quot; alt=&quot;Dark mode version of this site with a near black background, bright blue links, white text, and bright green header text&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://christopherhimes.com/assets/img//blog/light-and-dark/dark-mode.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The light mode which I imagine will be the way most people view the site uses an almost white background with medium green and blue for the headers and links respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;box white&quot;&gt;rgb(240,240,240)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;box medium-green&quot;&gt;rgb(0, 119, 83)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;box medium-blue&quot;&gt;rgb(1, 151, 189)&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;blogimg&quot; alt=&quot;Light mode version of this site with a near white background, medium blue links, near black text, and medium green header text&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://christopherhimes.com/assets/img//blog/light-and-dark/light-mode.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I’ve simplified the setup for light and dark based on a recent blog by &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesg.blog/2025/04/03/light-dark-root&quot;&gt;James G&lt;/a&gt; that was a follow up to his original post that inspired this setup in the first place. Previously the CSS suffered from the same redundancy he discussed in his blog post where every time a color was used it checked light-dark. Now this is baked into the :root variables like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;:root&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;color-scheme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;light&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;--background-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;light-dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;rgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;240&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;240&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;240&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;rgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;--foreground-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;light-dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;rgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;119&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;83&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;rgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;188&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;--link-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;light-dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;rgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;151&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;189&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;rgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;209&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;255&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;--text-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;light-dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;rgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;rgb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;240&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;240&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;240&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;--line-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;211&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;211&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;211&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;30%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows h1 to be styled like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;--foreground-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing is the use of gradients which also change in response to the light or dark settings from the user. One example is the site-tile which is just how my name at the top left on desktop or the top center on mobile is classed. The variables plug in just the same here but the added simplicity really helps the more complex -webkit-gradient lines legibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-css highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.site-title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&apos;lato-normal&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Arial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Helvetica&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sans-serif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;font-size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1.2em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;-webkit-gradient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;linear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;--foreground-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;--link-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;-webkit-background-clip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;background-clip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;-webkit-text-fill-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;transparent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;text-decoration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These screenshots were taken by me on 4/11/25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is day 6  of #100DaysToOffload.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Static Site Images</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently reaking this blog post by Kev Quirk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevquirk.com/blog/how-i-manage-jekyll-content&quot;&gt;image handling&lt;/a&gt; on his static site which inspired me to spend some time fixing the images on this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My includes are fairly similar to his but I’m passing a class as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-liquid highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;=&amp;lt;%&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;%&amp;gt;=}}&amp;lt;img&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;=&quot;blogimg&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;alt&lt;/span&gt;=&quot;{{include.alt}}&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;=&quot;lazy&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;=&quot;/assets/img/{{include.src}}&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image line in each post is identical to his handling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-liquid highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;img.html&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;alt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun side note in creating this post I learned that you have to use {% raw %} and {% endraw %} tags so the &lt;a href=&quot;https://heymichellemac.com/jekyll-liquid-tags-code-snippet&quot;&gt;liquid code&lt;/a&gt; wouldn’t run and replace that information. Also, these tags do not stack so you cannot show this code by putting raw/raw/endraw/endraw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this at least partially corrected I’ll be adding images to more posts going forward and revisiting the dark and light mode update with some images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here just because it would be bad form to have a post about images without including an image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;blogimg&quot; alt=&quot;T-Rex roaring in an urban downtown area&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://christopherhimes.com/assets/img//blog/static-images/static-dinosaur.webp&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is day 5  of #100DaysToOffload.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ActivityWatch</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;ActivityWatch is an app that automatically tracks how you spend time on your devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I mentioned in a previous post I found some new people to follow in my RSS reader. One of those people is &lt;a href=&quot;https://joelchrono.xyz&quot;&gt;Joel&lt;/a&gt; who’s feed introduced me to the service &lt;a href=&quot;https://activitywatch.net/&quot;&gt;ActivityWatch&lt;/a&gt;. This is now currently running on my machine so I can see how exactly I’m spending my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My intention for now is simply to use the reporting for self reflection. Not sure if I want to be publishing any stats publicly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is day 4  of #100DaysToOffload.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Added a Colophon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Added a &lt;a href=&quot;/colophon&quot;&gt;colophon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia lists a colophon as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In publishing, a colophon (/ˈkɒləfən, -fɒn/) is a brief statement containing information about the publication of a book such as an “imprint” (the place of publication, the publisher, and the date of publication).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My intention is to record the site history, technology stack, and other details of the site there. Really though, check that out if you’re interested in what drives this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is day 3  of #100DaysToOffload.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is day 1  of #100DaysToOffload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://100daystooffload.com/&quot;&gt;100 Days To Offload&lt;/a&gt; is a challenge to publish 100 posts on your personal blog in a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying to write more so I thought this would be a fun challenge. If you go to the website for the challenge they have a hall of fame for people that completed it. This means there are a number of interesting personal blogs to follow as well. Found a few more for the RSS reader.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Adding Pagination</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember exactly why I removed the pagination for this site but with the increase of blogs posts I felt that I needed to add it back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After trying and failing to get the standard &lt;em&gt;jekyll-paginate&lt;/em&gt; to work I went ahead and setup &lt;em&gt;jekyll-paginate-v2.&lt;/em&gt; This was easier than some had implied and look now there are multiple pages on this here blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was on the &lt;a href=&quot;/todo&quot;&gt;todo&lt;/a&gt; list so I updated that as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First you must install the gem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem install jekyll-paginate-v2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then make sure to update _config.yml. Obviously you don’t need all of these settings but this is what I’m using currently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plugins:
  - jekyll-paginate-v2

pagination:
  enabled: true
  per_page: 5
  permalink: &apos;/blog/page/:num/&apos;
  title: &apos;:title - page :num&apos;
  limit: 0
  sort_field: &apos;date&apos;
  sort_reverse: true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that did trip me up is I needed to set two permalinks, one for the page itself and another within the pagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;---
layout: page
title: blog
permalink: /blog/
pagination:
  enabled: true
  permalink: /blog/page/:num/
---
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here I added some padding to the pagination and centered it to make sure it was easy to see.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 13</title>
        <description>&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I made some additional changes to the resume.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Met with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nextjobtraining.com/&quot;&gt;NextJob&lt;/a&gt; job coach.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Applied to some jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Got a call about one of the positions that I applied for and will be following up next week.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Had lunch with my mom at Sy Thai.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did some classes on Coursera.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updated the Indeed profile.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enabled a month of LinkedIn Premium.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watched some Last of Us with my wife.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Played Uber driver taking Leah and Noah around town while her car is in the shop.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Solved the Cicada Detroit puzzle 19 and am immediately stuck on 20.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Started taking daily notes in service of writing this post.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed the time stamp in the footer of this page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Job Search Personality Test</title>
        <description>&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the job search and coaching I’ve taken a personality test offered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nextjobtraining.com/&quot;&gt;NextJob&lt;/a&gt;. Posted below are the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;gold-backup-blue-introvert&quot;&gt;Gold Backup Blue Introvert&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;overall&quot;&gt;Overall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realistic, grounded and practical, you are one of the pillars of your community and seen by others as able to get the job done. Gold/Blues honor “the system”, trust contracts and organize life and work around procedures. Your colleagues and family members all feel secure and stable under your watch - as long as they measure up to your high standards. You can, however, be the classic “Type A” personality, demanding much of others both at home and work. But those demands are never made capriciously; you think things through and always are cautious about changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With your highly developed management skills, duty-bound work ethic and ability to concentrate, you rise to top-level positions wherever you invest your efforts. Fierce loyalty to your company cements your status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When undertaking a task, you bring to it logic, impersonal analysis, common sense and practical experience. Golds gravitate to situations where you have to plan ahead, set goals and control the schedule. Highly observant of details, you are gifted at implementing well-defined policies and ensuring that things remain orderly and on track. While reserved, you communicate in a style that is clear and direct and are seen as fair and consistent when dealing with others. You honor traditions and rituals, observing holidays, religious and cultural events with appropriate fanfare. For you, these times are important symbols of continuity to be passed on to the next
generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Appropriateness” is your watchword. Your strong morals lead you to judge others, and speak up if they seem to blur right and wrong. You simply want the world to stay organized and free from the chaos that follows when rules are broken. Even flamboyant dress and unconventional behavior try your tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;natural-strengths&quot;&gt;Natural Strengths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Naturally adapt to the role assigned to you, be it leader or follower&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create and enforce policies, procedures, and schedules that keep everyone on track&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are fair with others and earn their respect&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have outstanding logistical skills – i.e. getting the right things, to the right people, in the right amounts, to the right place at the right time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Respect the chain of command&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attend to the practical needs of the organization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are decisive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uphold exacting standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your potential blind spots may include some of the following. 
You:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;May prematurely dismiss new ideas. (Dismiss nothing until you investigate.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;May see only the flaws in the efforts of others and not give credit where credit is due. (Make it a point of giving some sort of affirmation to colleagues before listing flaws.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on immediate results and overlook long-range implications. (Invest some time in long-range planning and get more comfortable with it as a tool.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are fixed in supporting established ways of doing things. (The tried-and-true contribute much to efficiency. But they won’t keep your company alive when the market is changing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are rigid about how others should perform their responsibilities. (Results are the priority, not necessarily the process of getting there. Respect other methods while awaiting results.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;best-work-environment&quot;&gt;Best Work Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be most productive and energized when your work culture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Has clear rules and expectations and a well-defined hierarchy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Includes hard-working and logical co-workers who pride themselves on doing things right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is a stable and well-respected institution with a predictable future. You work hard and want to be rewarded with money and respect.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rewards dependability and precision. You’re on time, have a well-planned schedule and do your job with consistency. No company runs well for long without a Gold/Blue Introvert&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Involves concrete and practical projects and products. Intangible services are tough for you to quantify and measure. Stick with the things you can touch and see.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is results-oriented. You are skeptical of any work that can’t be evaluated on a spreadsheet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Values loyalty and commitment. In today’s workplace, however, placing your loyalty with a mentor may be better.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allows for private space. As an Introvert, your batteries get drained when dealing with people, even if your people skills are superb. You think and perform better in a private space; insist on one as a condition of employment if at all possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;entrepreneurial-style&quot;&gt;Entrepreneurial Style&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-goals&quot;&gt;Setting Goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You excel at setting goals and making plans to achieve them. You prioritize, follow through and evaluate progress effortlessly. What you are not good at is modifying your ideas to adapt to changing circumstances. Before casting your business plan in stone, run it by people you respect who are of different from you. Ask them what additional options to consider. Don’t rush into it, even if you are excited and energized. Then, schedule re-evaluations at specific points along the way. Mark your calendar to sit back and reflect whether your goals are being met or you need to readjust them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;at-the-start-of-a-venture&quot;&gt;At the Start of a Venture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not one of the world’s “dreamers and schemers,” but many Golds have come up with brilliant business ideas and gotten rich from them. At your core, you are driven to be a responsible overseer of people and resources, and this makes you a cautious risk-taker. In your favor, you are not likely to be diverted by other opportunities. You will rely on tried-and-true methodology to move predictably from one milestone to the next.
Once in business, your first priority is establishing order. Systems and procedures are in place virtually from Day One. The sooner you can create predictability in your business, whether in sales, manufactured inventory or cash flow, the more comfortable you are.
Foreseeing and responding to changes in the marketplace will never be your forte, and handling unexpected crises is downright stressful to you. Make sure you have associates on board to handle emergencies and identify future trends and that might impact your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;approach-to-money--compensation&quot;&gt;Approach To Money &amp;amp; Compensation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finances-in-general&quot;&gt;Finances in general&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money is important to your sense of security. You are highly focused on saving and long-term planning, and fully in control of your cash flow at all times. You abhor the misuse of money and rarely go into debt or squander the assets you have. Your investments have to be well researched, backed by a solid track record and fully documented with concrete facts. As long as investments meet these criteria, you’ll invest directly in the market; but mutual funds are a popular option for Golds. You want your portfolio to be your passport to a worry-free future, and you are likely to achieve this goal early in life.
You have a limited tolerance for risk and volatility, favoring time-tested strategies. Fixed income instruments like bonds and GICs make you comfortable along with a portfolio of blue chip stocks. Meanwhile, you prefer working with well-established firms, insisting upon advisors who are organized, consistent and produce predictable results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;compensation--negotiating-style&quot;&gt;Compensation &amp;amp; Negotiating Style&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a focused and tough negotiator, having researched what you’re worth well in advance. Gold/Blues can be prone to “bag person syndrome” - the fear that you will wind up penniless on the streets. Because you feel your security is on the line, you accept nothing less than everything there is to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;job-search--your-strengths-and-potential-challenges&quot;&gt;Job Search – Your Strengths and Potential Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an interviewer whose style is close to your own, you will feel immediate rapport. However, if your interviewer is different, use the suggestions in parentheses below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In following your natural interviewing style, you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are calm and composed. (This can look like disinterest – make sure to speak more than you normally do, especially at first.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Present yourself as a capable and competent candidate. (You document your
experience well, in an easy-to-follow manner.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prefer written communications before face-to-face meetings. (Gather facts from all sources.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Share few feelings with people. (Interviewers rely on their emotional response to you as a big part of their decision-making process. Prioritize building a personal rapport with such an interviewer by preparing answers to their emotion-based questions. Role play with a friend.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on the present. (Especially if interviewing for a senior level position, you will need to prepare a position on future planning. Research public statements about the company’s future direction prior to an interview.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are patient with the length of the search and the procedures you need to follow. (You’re likely to be the last one standing in a multiple-interview, trial-task type of job screening.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow through with all details; respect deadlines and commitments. (Interviewers respect that you send requested items, call to follow up and send thank-you notes. Your natural career exploration and strategizing strengths allow you to:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be calm and composed in an interview&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on the needs of the present&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide specific information, especially about the steps involved in completing projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Present your background in a sequential, step-by-step way&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think before replying&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Show confidence in your ability to deal with bottom line issues In order to tone down your potential blind spots, you need to:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cushion your tendency to be abrupt; rehearse some areas of small talk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prepare questions to ask interviewer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prepare to talk about yourself on a personal level&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Express enthusiasm and be assertive about selling, not just stating, your accomplishments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do some thinking about a prospective company’s future direction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be willing to consider less obvious career opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here it listed out some possible jobs but I didn’t want to recreate all the formatting so I’ve included a link to it &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/pdf/Personality.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t necessarily agree with all of this but many things rang true which surprised me honestly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Light and Dark</title>
        <description>&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a fan of dark mode on sites, in development editors, and in the operating system too. Staring at a mostly white screen all day is exhausting and I like the way the content on screen emerges from the darkness with dark mode enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesg.blog/2024/11/24/dark-mode&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; from James G, I set about creating a light mode for this site. This is the reverse from what James had done as he started with a light mode but the the ideas are the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My :root to make this work currently looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;:root {
    color-scheme: light dark;
    --dark-background-color: rgb(26, 26, 26);
    --dark-foreground-color: rgb(32, 255, 188);
    --dark-link-color: rgb(25, 209, 255);
    --dark-text-color: rgb(240,240,240);

    --light-background-color: rgb(240,240,240);
    --light-foreground-color: rgb(0, 119, 83);    
    --light-link-color: rgb(1, 151, 189);
    --light-text-color: rgb(26, 26, 26);

    --line-color: rgba(211, 211, 211, 30%);
  }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;color-scheme&lt;/code&gt; term is required to respect the users setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the global variables set it’s just a matter of using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;light-dark()&lt;/code&gt; to set the appropriate colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;p, li, ul {
    color: light-dark(var(--light-text-color), var(--dark-text-color));
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still really prefer the dark mode version of the site, so check that out if you’re interested. It’s just a matter of toggling between light and dark in the browser settings. In Zen browser it’s in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;General &amp;gt; Language and Appearance&lt;/code&gt; which means I don’t even have to scroll in the settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which ever mode you prefer I hope you like what you see.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve updated the &lt;a href=&quot;/now&quot;&gt;now&lt;/a&gt; page following recent events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I have a few items I’ve identified and included in the &lt;a href=&quot;/todo&quot;&gt;todo&lt;/a&gt; list for the site. I don’t believe I’ve linked to this previously so I thought I would do so now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 12</title>
        <description>&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s week one of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://12weekyear.com/&quot;&gt;12 Week Year&lt;/a&gt; but it’s the 12th week of the year so I’m calling it week 12. This is meant to be forward looking to a week note for every week of the year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I updated my resume to showcase my experience, skills, and accomplishments as a Product Owner.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Signed up at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nextjobtraining.com/&quot;&gt;NextJob&lt;/a&gt; to take advantage of that benefit from my previous employer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scheduled a meeting with a job coach for next week.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/cshimes&quot;&gt;my LinkedIn profile&lt;/a&gt; and added a few people that I previously worked with in the past.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Originally planned to apply to a few jobs this week but have been saving them for next week and a better resume.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Started documenting some specific projects I’ve had at work over the last few years.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set resume/cv to appear in the main navigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Starting</title>
        <description>&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 16 years, 9 months and 12 days I’m unemployed. It’s upsetting and scary but also exciting in a way. That’s a long time for anyone to be doing something and it would be nice to do something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already I’m looking for ways to use my time productively. I’ve always been somewhat dubious about self help books and influencers of that type. However, I have found a few things lately that I’m going to try. Looking to add some structure in the near term but maybe they’ll stick around and become habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://doingweeknotes.com/&quot;&gt;Week Notes&lt;/a&gt;, a concept I’ve only been introduced to recently. The general idea is to post publicly (typically within an organization) what your team has worked on this week. Hopefully, making this information public gives other teams, leadership, etc., a better idea of what is going on. This of course is another silo breaking procedure but as activity more akin to a work journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having sent status emails for years this seems like a nice way to add context to whatever dates may be out there. For example if there is something that comes up unexpectedly this could appear in the weeknote and help avoid future surprises. Of course this is not a replacement for other forms of communication but it may reach people outside of traditional channels. The public forum means not having to guess who should be included on the email chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly than that a team can celebrate a win every week. There are things worth celebrating all the time. Too often focus is on a larger deliverable when so many smaller victories happen every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What does that mean for me though?&lt;/em&gt; I’m going to be working toward my next job every week and documenting these efforts may help me. Having a bit of a self check-in weekly seems valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the rest of the plan I’m starting today. I’m acting with intent over the next 12 weeks implementing a much more casual version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://12weekyear.com/&quot;&gt;12 Week Year&lt;/a&gt; after watching this &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/5SPjd9Zu4-w?si=rjBU_E7WPI-ww1KC&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; by Zach Highley. I’ve made a few goals and I’m going to keep track of what I’m doing to try and accomplish them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help me keep track of my goals and my planned activities for the 12 weeks I’ve added a template already setup for this sort of thing on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so&quot;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re not famililar with Notion it started as a note taking app like Evernote. But it has turned into a suite of tools for project management, documentation, and collaboration. Random promotion of Notion aside I’ve got the system setup I just need to start the work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Now Page 2024</title>
        <description>&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While looking at personal sites for inspiration I found the idea of a now page. So I decided to make one for myself. There are lots of examples of this on &lt;a href=&quot;https://nownownow.com&quot;&gt;NowNowNow&lt;/a&gt; but my now page is located at &lt;a href=&quot;/now&quot;&gt;/now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now it includes a personal, movie/TV, and music section. For the music section I’ve added a line about the latest song I listened to on &lt;a href=&quot;https://spotify.com&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&quot;https://last.fm&quot;&gt;last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a good opportunity to implement api access on the site via a private key. Which is something I understood in practice but had never actually implemented myself. Just not something I had experimented with in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing I did was go to last.fm and get an api key. From there I read the documentation they provided and reviewed samples I found just searching ye olde interweb. Using the most barebone page imaginable to use the key and retrieve the information I was looking for. I have to say there was more trial and error than I thought here which I think is largely due to the type of documentation provided in the api docs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, with that done I knew I could pull the information I was looking for and format it as needed. Piecing together the song title, artist, and album of the latest song was complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I needed to move that private key somewhere to actually keep it private. While the test had hard coded the key onto the page it needs to be stored as an environment variable and accessed in a way that does not expose it to a client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily for me, my host of choice &lt;a href=&quot;https://netlify.com&quot;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt; has some good documentation and site configuration to make this easier. There is a section for Environment Variables within the site configuration which allowed me to specify the api key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there I would need a way to access that information at run time versus having the build of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; site pull it into the code of the site. This was achieved by the use of Netlify functions which allow for server side Javascript to be run to access environment variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to this addition there was not much configuration in the setup of this site for the Netlify build. Now there are a few more requirements and I’m not sure if it could go back to GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my compuslive upgrading has delayed the launch of the page a bit as well as a few of the supporting tools to build the site had some cascading dependency issues tied to updating one piece or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the api key was setup, kept private in environment variables, accessed via a server side function call, and used to pull song details, I was ready to build the rest of the /now page. I had originally just setup a HTML page but I went ahead and converted it to markdown to utilize the existing templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I had to decide what was even happening now which I kept pretty light as it is just a first pass. I think having the page out there and reviewing it periodically would be a good sanity check from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Simple Silly</title>
        <description>&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided not to figure out an image for this post and see if that helps get it together faster. I’m not happy with how the images I have on previous posts work with the latest layouts so I’m considering dropping them all together. I do think I could pull original sources and have the look less terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent changes on the site have been focusing on un-bootstrapping the site. This is an excuse in part to experiment with flex box and modern CSS in general. I do not have any projects outside of this site that can scratch that itch. So I figured I would expriment with the site at first and then branch into other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading lots of blogs about things to add to personal sites. So I am making a list and will be making chainges and posting more often (he says again).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m happy with how much simple the site is now. Not having to provide all of bootstrap has significantly reduced the payload for a first draw.The site does not need a bunch of fancy buttons or styling so the critical css file is small. Frankly, it could be smaller still but I’m not great at css let alone optimizing css.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a version of the site that included cards for the blog posts including gradient borders with rounded corners but I decided to scale that way back. I’m not sure about the dashed lines but they work for the moment. I miss cleaner sites so I have been looking at simpler sites for inspiration. There are some fun ideas out there that I plan to incorporate to the site or just as a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lighthouse</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../assets/img/blog/lighthouse/lighthouse.webp&quot; alt=&quot;image of a lighthouse&quot; title=&quot;Lighthouse at night with lots of stars and the light from the house shining bright.&quot; class=&quot;main-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site is not big, but it is faster, and more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the briefest of lead ins to this project I wanted to learn about modern approaches to speed and accessibility. I’ve spent some time on Mastodon and follow a number of people that post about these topics regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want this site to function as fast as it can and be accessible to folks who may not be interacting with it the same way I am. With that as a goal I downloaded the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse&quot;&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; extension to analyze this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting off the site looked good for SEO and best practices but had some room for improvement with both performance and accessibility. Thankfully the score for each section comes with specific problems and ways to improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For performance images were the largest issue. They have been resized and converted to webp (from jpg). This brought the score up to 100 on desktop but the mobile version only ever got up to 95%. There remains a bit of css that is load blocking and I have not been able to find a way to resolve it without a significant rewrite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as accessibility goes the usual suspects were the culprits. Images lacked alt tags and contrast was too low with some color choices for links. This is relatively easy to resolve. I updated my color choices in CSS to increase contrast. Here too mobile is at 95% and I cannot figure out why. Out of frustration I set the links to white and the background to black and Lighthouse still reported a contrast issue. Anyway I’ve been updating alt tags but I will probably go back and make them a little better when I have time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the final scores!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;desktop&quot;&gt;Desktop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../assets/img/blog/lighthouse/lighthouse-desktop.webp&quot; alt=&quot;desktop score&quot; title=&quot;Lighthouse scores for desktop. Performance is 100%. Accessibility is 100%. Best Practices is 100%. SEO is 100%.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mobile&quot;&gt;Mobile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../assets/img/blog/lighthouse/lighthouse-mobile.webp&quot; alt=&quot;mobile score&quot; title=&quot;Lighthouse scores for mobile. Performance is 95%. Accessibility is 95%. Best Practices is 100%. SEO is 100%.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to have these scores as high as they are but I do not think this is over just yet. Having read a bunch of ways to improve things, now I want to go further. 95% is pretty good on mobile for performance and accessibility but is there any reason why these cannot be 100% as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rewrite I mentioned earlier is incoming. This site is simply more complicated than it needs to be and I really want to experiment with critical CSS being inlined to prevent load blocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no reason that this site should be a recolor of an existing theme. Especially when that theme is introducing so much unnecessary overhead. Anyway, more on that to come.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I got married!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../assets/img/blog/i-got-married/married.webp&quot; alt=&quot;main-image&quot; title=&quot;Married&quot; class=&quot;main-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a little over a month now since I got married.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all the planning had been going on for a few years and I’m happy to say everything went really well. We benefitted greatly by having the entire event in one location. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thewhitney.com/&quot;&gt;The Whitney&lt;/a&gt; is a really nice venue with an outdoor location for the ceremony and delicious food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We managed to find lots of great inspiration on Pinterest and vendors on Etsy. There are threats at the moment that Etsy is going in a bad direction but we’ve been very happy with the vendors we found. We spent way too long considering invitations but managed to pick out just about everything else very quickly. It was really nice to know that when planning something my wife and I were so in sync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a first look in the library with just us and her son.The ceremony was in the garden where the weather was warm for May but sunny. It was late enough in the year that everything was green and some flowers had bloomed. It was a small ceremony and dinner with just close family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photos took a long time but we’re really happy with the result. I’ve updated my socials with a solo image from the day which I like quite a bit. We’ve got a book being printed and we are going to pick out at least one image to frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the wedding we stayed downtown at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedetroitclub.com/&quot;&gt;The Detroit Club&lt;/a&gt; which was a bit fancy but the stay was relaxing. We were within walking distance of a Starbucks and we booked a spa day. The Movement festival was happening downtown so when we rode the People Mover there were some interesting folks making their way around town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The image above is from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://leahandchristopherhimes.com&quot;&gt;wedding site&lt;/a&gt; I made but never showed to anyone but my wife.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My blog has &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinmastodon.org/&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; powered comments now and this post is really just a test for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is almost completely the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cassidyjames.com/blog/fediverse-blog-comments-mastodon/&quot;&gt;Cassidy James&lt;/a&gt; implementation of comments via Mastodon. Although I do have plans to do some more specific styling for this site it works well as is. Don’t have much more to say about it other than thanks to Mr. James and if you’re interested in adding Mastodon comments to your site I’ve linked to Cassidy’s post about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may go back and add comments to previous posts but for now this post will be the only one with comments. The implementation requires an API call with reference to an existing post on Mastodon and I’m not sure if I want to be posting about previous entries in this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Stream?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../assets/img/blog/a-stream/stream.webp&quot; alt=&quot;main-image&quot; title=&quot;Stream&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been tinkering around with livestreaming and wanted to document some of the things I found. The experiment has been to stream to both Twitch and YouTube starting with just one or the other and eventually to both at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, lets talk audio. I’ve spent far too much time adjusting the audio for both personal streaming and for work. Current setup utilizes &lt;a href=&quot;https://vb-audio.com&quot;&gt;virtual cables&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsproject.com&quot;&gt;obs&lt;/a&gt; studio filters to achieve what I think is pretty good sounding audio. I’ve primarily been following &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@EposVox&quot;&gt;EposVox&lt;/a&gt; audio quality guides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m using a shock mounted Yeti Blue microphone and passing it throught Noise Suppression using the built in RNNoise method. I haven’t noticed any CPU impact and this works so well. I have the gain on the microphone down very low but I’ve turned the digital gain boosted by 10 dB. This can sound weird without additional filtering but increases my volume without having to be right on top of the microphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next there are a few rounds of correcting for that initial gain boosting and making things sound good. The first round of EQ that uses ReaEQ mostly to cut highs, lows, and a few nasaly places in the mids. This is followed up with a compressor with a 3:1 ratio and a -20dB threshold. From there I do have a Noise Gate set but I’m not sure if it is strictly necessary with all the other things happening. Lastly, there is an additional EQ for some high end and normal speaking range boosting for clarity and to add interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the camera side I have a Razer Kiyo that has most of the default settings but with the white balance manually adjusted. It never quite gets that right and I haven’t found the right filters to counter it consistently. I do typically increase the contrast a little and apply a LUT. This is mostly to add back in some warmth as the default settings can read a bit cold. One thing I wanted to add is that the camera in obs has its own dedicated scene that is then added to other scenes to enable different presentation of the same source. I was running into an issue where changing it on one scene would change it in every scene. This is apparently a known thing about obs but it did cause some confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The baked in streaming setup for OBS is so good it doesn’t typically need to be tweaked. I spent the beter part of the last year streaming exclusively to twitch. This is for a few reasons. First, up until recently it was against twitch’s terms of service to stream to more than one platform. Also, for whatever reason I associate twitch with streaming more than YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been experimenting doing both lately but have determined the only way for me to do that is to use a third party. Specifically, I’ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://restream.io&quot;&gt;Restream&lt;/a&gt; to simultaneously stream to both twitch and YouTube. My upload bandwith is not good so I cannot support both at the same time myself. Setting these up is no more complicated than setting up accounts at each and giving access to Restream. The most complicated piece is setting some of the bitrate and sizing information that will work for both. My current setup is not as good for YouTube as it could be due to the limitations coming from twitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stream infrequently, but when I do it’s at either &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/entropygrows/&quot;&gt;EntropyGrows Twitch&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@entropygrows9669&quot;&gt;EntropyGrows YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Another New Design</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../..../../../../assets/img/blog/another-new-design/design.webp&quot; alt=&quot;main-image&quot; title=&quot;Design&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a new design, yes it is! This site gets more visual updates than it does blog posts but that’s where we’re at currently. What follows is a brief write up about the decisions that went into reworking the design of this site and what is to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous template for the site used an altered version of a template that I liked but was never quite happy with. This new version takes a similar approach but is way easier to setup and make adjustments. The other piece to consider is that I never really felt comfortable with leading with a blog as I’m not great about keeping up with it obviously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few things about this template and the adjustments I’ve made that I’m happy with. For instance there is significantly less visual clutter on any and every page involved. As I mentioned above I don’t want to lead with a blog so now there is an introductory header element that has my face and a tag line introduction. This is preferable to jumping right into a blog for me. My preference is for dark mode reading so the site reflects that. There is some additional adjustment required to get it where it needs to be but I’m happy with it for now. Additionally I’ve added some brand colors that were lacking in the previous site which was all grey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next approach is to optimize and make it more accessible. I’ve ran lighthouse on it and the plan is to make as many of the suggested changes as possible. One main problem that I agree with and want to correct first is the level of contrast. Some of the colors I’ve chosen and even the standard text are not easy enough to read. I like the way it looks currently but I do hope I’m not the only one that ever looks at the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to follow some tutorials and add comments to my posts. While I don’t suppose I’ll get much in the way of interaction the project to add them using ActivityPub via Mastodon seems interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next projects will be documented and shared here. I’m not a web developer but I do like to poke around with this sort of thing so I’ll be recording that information in a blog in 2023 and beyond. Imagine that!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I&apos;m Virtual Now</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../..../../../../assets/img/blog/virtual/virtual.webp&quot; alt=&quot;virtual-image&quot; title=&quot;Virtual&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess ‘now’ is relative with working at home for the last two years. As of yesterday I no longer have a desk at an office that I could return to when this whole pandemic blows over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a new role, responsibilities, and more people relying on me than I ever have before. This requires me to make fewer explorations into pet projects. In the past I could find some faster way of doing something work related but now I need to delegate that activity to someone else.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
As a Product Owner the daily activities do not typically require much coding so I’m thinking of spending more personal time trying different things out. I downloaded &lt;a href=&quot;https://blender.org&quot;&gt;blender&lt;/a&gt; again and am thinking of playing with some procedural generation. Last week I wrote some &lt;a href=&quot;https://python.org&quot;&gt;python&lt;/a&gt; code to grab some image data so I am thinking about some python projects down the road as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before digging too much into any of that this site’s dependencies are out of control and my plan is to remove them and simplify the entire setup. Not seeing the point in a build process that is broken every time I attempt to build this site. What I mean is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gulpjs.com/&quot;&gt;gulp&lt;/a&gt; setup will be scaled back dramatically and the patchwork of node modules that build this site will be mostly removed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Time for a Change</title>

&lt;p&gt;The changes to this site now are strictly cosmetic but it is interesting to play with the capabilities of Sass and CSS.  I’ve been unenthusiastic about the previous color scheme for a while so this is a nice brighter setup.

        <title>Take it Home With You</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../../../../../assets/img/blog/take-it-home-with-you/home.webp&quot; alt=&quot;home-image&quot; title=&quot;Home&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next two weeks are going to be exceedingly difficult not to bring work home.  I’m prone to work through things I’m working on at work while I’m at home.  This usually stays to the realm of talking through possible solutions or planning my day or week ahead of time.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
Today, I went as far as signing into Citrix, Trello, and Slack to plan the upcoming week.  We have a fairly aggressive timeline on the current project and I’d prefer to avoid anyone else having to spend time on it outside of work.  I think we can make the timing work we just have to stick to the plan and hopefully do away with any unknowns early in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is the first big project with the new team.  We’ve got everyone up to speed and on the same page, so I forsee a busy but productive week.  I’m excited to demonstrate all of what we can do.&lt;/p&gt;

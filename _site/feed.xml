        <title>Another New Design</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../images/blog/design.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;main-image&quot; title=&quot;Design&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a new design, yes it is! This site gets more visual updates than it does blog posts but that’s where we’re at currently. What follows is a brief write up about the decisions that went into reworking the design of this site and what is to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous template for the site used an altered version of a template that I liked but was never quite happy with. This new version takes a similar approach but is way easier to setup and make adjustments. The other piece to consider is that I never really felt comfortable with leading with a blog as I’m not great about keeping up with it obviously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few things about this template and the adjustments I’ve made that I’m happy with. For instance there is significantly less visual clutter on any and every page involved. As I mentioned above I don’t want to lead with a blog so now there is an introductory header element that has my face and a tag line introduction. This is preferable to jumping right into a blog for me. My preference is for dark mode reading so the site reflects that. There is some additional adjustment required to get it where it needs to be but I’m happy with it for now. Additionally I’ve added some brand colors that were lacking in the previous site which was all grey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next approach is to optimize and make it more accessible. I’ve ran lighthouse on it and the plan is to make as many of the suggested changes as possible. One main problem that I agree with and want to correct first is the level of contrast. Some of the colors I’ve chosen and even the standard text are not easy enough to read. I like the way it looks currently but I do hope I’m not the only one that ever looks at the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to follow some tutorials and add comments to my posts. While I don’t suppose I’ll get much in the way of interaction the project to add them using ActivityPub via Mastodon seems interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next projects will be documented and shared here. I’m not a web developer but I do like to poke around with this sort of thing so I’ll be recording that information in a blog in 2023 and beyond. Imagine that!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I&apos;m Virtual Now</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../images/blog/virtual.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;virtual-image&quot; title=&quot;Virtual&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess ‘now’ is relative with working at home for the last two years. As of yesterday I no longer have a desk at an office that I could return to when this whole pandemic blows over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a new role, responsibilities, and more people relying on me than I ever have before. This requires me to make fewer explorations into pet projects. In the past I could find some faster way of doing something work related but now I need to delegate that activity to someone else.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
As a Product Owner the daily activities do not typically require much coding so I’m thinking of spending more personal time trying different things out. I downloaded &lt;a href=&quot;https://blender.org&quot;&gt;blender&lt;/a&gt; again and am thinking of playing with some procedural generation. Last week I wrote some &lt;a href=&quot;https://python.org&quot;&gt;python&lt;/a&gt; code to grab some image data so I am thinking about some python projects down the road as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before digging too much into any of that this site’s dependencies are out of control and my plan is to remove them and simplify the entire setup. Not seeing the point in a build process that is broken every time I attempt to build this site. What I mean is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gulpjs.com/&quot;&gt;gulp&lt;/a&gt; setup will be scaled back dramatically and the patchwork of node modules that build this site will be mostly removed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Time for a Change</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../images/blog/change.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;change-image&quot; title=&quot;change image&quot; /&gt;
The changes to this site now are strictly cosmetic but it is interesting to play with the capabilities of Sass and CSS.  I’ve been unenthusiastic about the previous color scheme for a while so this is a nice brighter setup.

        <title>Take it Home With You</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../../../../images/blog/home.png&quot; alt=&quot;home-image&quot; title=&quot;Home&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next two weeks are going to be exceedingly difficult not to bring work home.  I’m prone to work through things I’m working on at work while I’m at home.  This usually stays to the realm of talking through possible solutions or planning my day or week ahead of time.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
Today, I went as far as signing into Citrix, Trello, and Slack to plan the upcoming week.  We have a fairly aggressive timeline on the current project and I’d prefer to avoid anyone else having to spend time on it outside of work.  I think we can make the timing work we just have to stick to the plan and hopefully do away with any unknowns early in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is the first big project with the new team.  We’ve got everyone up to speed and on the same page, so I forsee a busy but productive week.  I’m excited to demonstrate all of what we can do.&lt;/p&gt;
